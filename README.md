# NetPulse
NetPulse is a Wi-Fi  Analysis Toolkit.
NetPulse is a powerful and feature-rich Wi-Fi analyzer designed for IT professionals, network administrators, and tech enthusiasts. It transforms your Android device into a professional-grade tool for scanning, analyzing, and optimizing wireless networks. With full support for 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and the latest 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E) bands, NetPulse provides all the insights you need to ensure peak network performance.

Key Features:

1. Detailed Access Point Overview

Get an immediate, real-time list of all nearby Wi-Fi networks. Each entry provides essential information at a glance, including:

Signal Strength (dBm): Accurately measure the strength of each network.

Channel & Frequency: Identify the exact channel and frequency being used.

Channel Width: See the bandwidth (20/40/80/160 MHz) of each access point.

Security: Quickly see the security protocols in use (WPA3, WPA2, WPA, etc.).

Estimated Distance: Get an approximate distance to the access point.

Wi-Fi Standard: Icons indicate the Wi-Fi generation (e.g., Wi-Fi 6).

2. Visual Channel Graph

Visualize the entire Wi-Fi spectrum to easily identify channel overlap and interference. The intuitive graph plots all nearby networks by their channel and signal strength, helping you find the least congested channel to move your network to.

3. Intelligent Channel Rating

Take the guesswork out of optimization. The Channel Rating screen analyzes network congestion and provides a simple star-based rating for every channel. It even suggests the "Best Channels" for your network, making it easy to choose the ideal configuration for maximum speed and stability.

4. Signal Strength Time Graph

Troubleshoot intermittent connectivity issues by tracking signal strength over time. The Time Graph plots the dBm of selected networks, allowing you to identify signal fluctuations and potential sources of interference that occur over a period.

5. Comprehensive Band Support (Wi-Fi 6E Ready)

NetPulse is built for the future. It fully supports scanning and analysis on the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and the new 6 GHz bands, making it an essential tool for deploying and managing the latest Wi-Fi 6E networks. The "Available Channels" screen provides a complete list of channels supported by your device for every band and width.

6. Powerful Filtering & Sorting

Effortlessly manage long lists of networks with advanced filtering options. You can filter the access point list by:

SSID (Network Name)

Wi-Fi Band (2.4, 5, or 6 GHz)

Signal Strength

Security Type
